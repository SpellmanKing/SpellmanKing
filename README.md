# 📕 About Me
Hello! I'm Calebe, a Developer in Training 🚀
I'm a technology enthusiast currently in the 2nd semester of Analysis and Systems Development (ADS) at Unieuro. My journey is focused on building the bridge between theory and practice, and I am actively seeking my first professional experience in the field.

My Focus Areas & Ambitions:
My passion lies in developing robust solutions. I am dedicating my studies to:

Core Languages: Deepening my knowledge in Python and Java.

Software Development: Aiming to enhance the creation of efficient software, websites, programs, and systems.

Big Challenges: Increasing my capacity to contribute to larger and more complex projects in the tech industry.

Diving into Artificial Intelligence (AI) 🧠
I am currently part of Unieuro's Scientific Initiation (IC) project, focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence.

I already have practical experience in developing automated systems and manipulating LLMs using the Python ecosystem libraries, including Hugging Face.

Connect with me! Let's collaborate on high-impact projects.
